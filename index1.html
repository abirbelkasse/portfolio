    <p>In around 2 years I've gone from fiddling with web stuff in my free time to a very successful freelancing career, and here's what I've learned:
      Become fluent in the whole stack, from server administration to front end design. A lot of people will tell you to specialize, and that you can't become great at anything if you try to get good at everything, but this is BS. Anyone can learn anything, and often times the stuff you learn about one aspect of web development helps you learn stuff about another. The best part, however, is that you open up your market of potential clients as wide as it can possibly be. There's really no excuse not to learn the whole stack unless you just want to go work for some company.
      Build and rebuild your own personal site again and again. I make sure to rebuild my personal site from scratch at least once a year, often times more than that. I have landed many high paying contracts simply because people like what I've done with my personal site. Keep it relevant, modern, and in pace with current design trends. This is also a great first project if you're just starting to learn everything
      Get involved in the local web development and programming communities. These days, all my best contracts come from my connections to my local development groups. Start going to monthly meetups, give a presentation at a few of them, even if it's just you showing off your site or talking about some new trends in design or development. If you can establish yourself as a reliable and talented web guy you will have more work than you know what to do with.
      Don't quit your day job immediately. Being a freelancer is stressful because your next paycheck isn't guaranteed. It can be extremely overwhelming to cut out all your income and try to find work, especially when you're still learning the trade. Ease into it by spending your free time learning stuff, building personal projects, and even fulfilling some manageable contracts.</p>
